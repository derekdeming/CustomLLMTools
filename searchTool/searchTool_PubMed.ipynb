Nutrition care studies have proposed that early interventions targeting nutrition assessment can prevent or minimize the complications of undernutrition. Stress promotes an acute inflammatory response mediated by cytokines, resulting in increased basal metabolism and nitrogen excretion and leading to muscle loss and changes in body composition. Therefore, the inclusion of body composition assessment is important in the evaluation of these patients because, in addition to the nutrition aspect, body composition seems to predict clinical prognosis. Several techniques can be used to assess body composition, such as arm measurements, calf circumference, grip strength, bioelectrical impedance analysis, and imaging examinations, including computed tomography and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. This review of available evidence suggests that arm measurements seem to be well-established in assessing body composition in children who are critically ill, and that bioelectrical impedance analysis with phase angle, handgrip strength, calf circumference and ultrasound seem to be promising in this evaluation. However, further robust studies based on scientific evidence are necessary.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Commercial raw or minimally processed diets, often referred to holistically as raw-meat based diets (RMBD) represent a small portion of the pet food market, but the growth of this sector has been significant in recent years. While traditionally, high-moisture, frozen options were the standard format of commercially available raw diets, freeze-dried raw diets have become more prevalent as of late. Despite the increasing popularity of these commercial raw diet formats, there is a dearth of literature describing their nutritional properties, particularly regarding freeze-dried diets. Therefore, the objective of this experiment was to determine and compare the standardized amino acid (AA) digestibilities and nitrogen-corrected true metabolizable energy (TMEn) of raw frozen and freeze-dried dog foods using precision-fed cecectomized and conventional rooster assays. Three formats of frozen or freeze-dried raw diets provided by Primal Pet Foods (Fairfield, CA, USA) were tested: traditional freeze-dried nuggets (T-FDN), hybrid freeze-dried nuggets (H-FDN), and frozen nuggets (FZN). Diets were fed to cecectomized roosters (4 roosters/diet) to determine AA digestibilities, while conventional roosters (4 roosters/diet) were used to determine TMEn. In both cases, after 26\\xa0h of feed withdrawal, roosters were tube-fed 12-13\\xa0g of test diets and 12-13\\xa0g of corn. Following crop intubation, excreta were collected for 48\\xa0h. Endogenous corrections for AA were made using 5 additional cecectomized roosters. All data were analyzed using the Mixed Models procedure of SAS version 9.4. There were no significant differences in standardized AA digestibilities among diets, with digestibilities being high for all diets tested. For most of the indispensable AA, digestibilities were greater than or equal to 90% for all diets. Histidine and lysine were the exceptions, with digestibilities ranging from 82%-87% and 87-92%, respectively. Moreover, the reactive lysine:total lysine ratio, a measure of heat damage, ranged from 0.91 to 0.95. TMEn values were higher (P = 0.0127) in T-FDN (6.1 kcal/g) and FZN (5.9 kcal/g) than H-FDN (5.3 kcal/g) and were most similar to those estimated by Atwater factors. In general, all diets tested had high AA digestibilities and had TMEn values that were most similar to Atwater factors.',\n",

The optimization included the derivatization temperature, reaction time, reagent dosage and solid phase extraction cartridges, eluent and pH of the loading sample.

Soil properties, plant diversity and biomass were measured, and the ecological processes and environmental factors driving bacterial community changes were further explored. Results indicated that the Shannon diversity of soil bacterial communities decreased significantly only under the combination treatment, which might due to the decreased plant diversity. Soil bacterial community composition was significantly correlated with soil pH, and was affected obviously by the combination treatment. At the taxonomic classification, the relative abundance of Xanthobacteraceae and Beijerinckiaceae increased 127.67 and 107.62%, while the relative abundance of Rubrobacteriaceae and Micromonosporaceae decreased 78.29 and 54.72% under the combination treatment. Functional genes related to nitrogen and phosphorus transformation were enhanced in the combination treatment. Furthermore, weighted mean ribosomal operon copy numbers that positively correlated with plant aboveground biomass increased remarkably in the combination treatment, indicating a trend of life-history strategies shift from oligotrophic to copiotrophic.

       "  'abstract': 'Food systems are among the leading causes for transgression of planetary boundaries globally, which define the safe operating space for humanity. We quantify unsustainable environmental impacts of food systems, indicated by the transgression of national-scale planetary boundaries (i.e., the safe operating space for food production in each country), from both production and consumption perspectives of 189 countries/regions around the world. A multi-regional input-output model is used to map the global transfers of the national-scale transgression of planetary boundaries, including freshwater use, land change, and biogeochemical flows (nitrogen and phosphorus). Our results show that China is a major global unsustainable water and nitrogen exporter and an unstable land and phosphorus importer. This means that water and nitrogen uses in China are used to support food demands in other countries, and food consumption in China requires unsustainable land and phosphorus uses elsewhere. In contrast, the US is a major exporter of unsustainable water, land, and nitrogen uses but only an importer of unsustainable phosphorus for food consumption. Globally, compared to a counterfactual scenario where there is no food trade among any countries, food trade saves massive transgressions of planetary boundaries (270\\xa0km',\n",

The role of the pre-CAR bone marrow (BM) stromal microenvironment in determining response to CAR T-cell therapy has been understudied. We performed whole transcriptome analysis, reticulin fibrosis assessment and CD3 T-cell infiltration on BM core biopsies from pre- and post-CAR timepoints for 61 patients, as well as on a cohort of 54 primary B-ALL samples. Pathways of fibrosis, extracellular matrix development, and associated transcription factors AP1 and TGF-β3, were enriched and upregulated in nonresponders (NR) even prior to CAR T cell therapy. NR showed significantly higher levels of BM fibrosis compared to complete responders by both clinical reticulin assessment and AI-assisted digital image scoring. CD3+ T cells showed a trend toward lower infiltration in NR. NR had significantly higher levels of pre-CAR fibrosis compared to primary B-ALL. High levels of fibrosis were associated with lower overall survival after CAR T-cell therapy. In conclusion, BM fibrosis is a novel mechanism mediating nonresponse to CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy in B-ALL. A widely used clinically assay for quantitating myelofibrosis can be repurposed to determine patients at high risk of non-response.
