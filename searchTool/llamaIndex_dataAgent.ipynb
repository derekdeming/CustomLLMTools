Nutrition care studies have proposed that early interventions targeting nutrition assessment can prevent or minimize the complications of undernutrition. Stress promotes an acute inflammatory response mediated by cytokines, resulting in increased basal metabolism and nitrogen excretion and leading to muscle loss and changes in body composition. Therefore, the inclusion of body composition assessment is important in the evaluation of these patients because, in addition to the nutrition aspect, body composition seems to predict clinical prognosis. Several techniques can be used to assess body composition, such as arm measurements, calf circumference, grip strength, bioelectrical impedance analysis, and imaging examinations, including computed tomography and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. This review of available evidence suggests that arm measurements seem to be well-established in assessing body composition in children who are critically ill, and that bioelectrical impedance analysis with phase angle, handgrip strength, calf circumference and ultrasound seem to be promising in this evaluation. However, further robust studies based on scientific evidence are necessary.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Commercial raw or minimally processed diets, often referred to holistically as raw-meat based diets (RMBD) represent a small portion of the pet food market, but the growth of this sector has been significant in recent years. While traditionally, high-moisture, frozen options were the standard format of commercially available raw diets, freeze-dried raw diets have become more prevalent as of late. Despite the increasing popularity of these commercial raw diet formats, there is a dearth of literature describing their nutritional properties, particularly regarding freeze-dried diets. Therefore, the objective of this experiment was to determine and compare the standardized amino acid (AA) digestibilities and nitrogen-corrected true metabolizable energy (TMEn) of raw frozen and freeze-dried dog foods using precision-fed cecectomized and conventional rooster assays. Three formats of frozen or freeze-dried raw diets provided by Primal Pet Foods (Fairfield, CA, USA) were tested: traditional freeze-dried nuggets (T-FDN), hybrid freeze-dried nuggets (H-FDN), and frozen nuggets (FZN). Diets were fed to cecectomized roosters (4 roosters/diet) to determine AA digestibilities, while conventional roosters (4 roosters/diet) were used to determine TMEn. In both cases, after 26\\xa0h of feed withdrawal, roosters were tube-fed 12-13\\xa0g of test diets and 12-13\\xa0g of corn. Following crop intubation, excreta were collected for 48\\xa0h. Endogenous corrections for AA were made using 5 additional cecectomized roosters. All data were analyzed using the Mixed Models procedure of SAS version 9.4. There were no significant differences in standardized AA digestibilities among diets, with digestibilities being high for all diets tested. For most of the indispensable AA, digestibilities were greater than or equal to 90% for all diets. Histidine and lysine were the exceptions, with digestibilities ranging from 82%-87% and 87-92%, respectively. Moreover, the reactive lysine:total lysine ratio, a measure of heat damage, ranged from 0.91 to 0.95. TMEn values were higher (P = 0.0127) in T-FDN (6.1 kcal/g) and FZN (5.9 kcal/g) than H-FDN (5.3 kcal/g) and were most similar to those estimated by Atwater factors. In general, all diets tested had high AA digestibilities and had TMEn values that were most similar to Atwater factors.',\n",

Soil properties, plant diversity and biomass were measured, and the ecological processes and environmental factors driving bacterial community changes were further explored. Results indicated that the Shannon diversity of soil bacterial communities decreased significantly only under the combination treatment, which might due to the decreased plant diversity. Soil bacterial community composition was significantly correlated with soil pH, and was affected obviously by the combination treatment. At the taxonomic classification, the relative abundance of Xanthobacteraceae and Beijerinckiaceae increased 127.67 and 107.62%, while the relative abundance of Rubrobacteriaceae and Micromonosporaceae decreased 78.29 and 54.72% under the combination treatment. Functional genes related to nitrogen and phosphorus transformation were enhanced in the combination treatment. Furthermore, weighted mean ribosomal operon copy numbers that positively correlated with plant aboveground biomass increased remarkably in the combination treatment, indicating a trend of life-history strategies shift from oligotrophic to copiotrophic.

We quantify unsustainable environmental impacts of food systems, indicated by the transgression of national-scale planetary boundaries (i.e., the safe operating space for food production in each country), from both production and consumption perspectives of 189 countries/regions around the world. A multi-regional input-output model is used to map the global transfers of the national-scale transgression of planetary boundaries, including freshwater use, land change, and biogeochemical flows (nitrogen and phosphorus). Our results show that China is a major global unsustainable water and nitrogen exporter and an unstable land and phosphorus importer. This means that water and nitrogen uses in China are used to support food demands in other countries, and food consumption in China requires unsustainable land and phosphorus uses elsewhere. In contrast, the US is a major exporter of unsustainable water, land, and nitrogen uses but only an importer of unsustainable phosphorus for food consumption. Globally, compared to a counterfactual scenario where there is no food trade among any countries, food trade saves massive transgressions of planetary boundaries (270\\xa0km',\n",

This oncoprotein interferes with cellular signaling pathways, resulting in tumor progression. Among these pathways, PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is significantly upregulated in CML. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are current standard therapy for CML, and they have shown remarkable efficacy. However, emergence of TKIs drug resistance has necessitated investigation of novel therapeutic approaches. Components of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway have emerged as attractive targets in this context, as this pathway is known to be activated in TKIs-resistant CML cells/patients. Inhibiting this pathway may provide a complementary approach to improving TKIs' efficacy and treatment outcomes. Given previous research indicating that miRNAs play an inhibitory role in cancer, current study used computational tools to identify miRNAs that specifically target pathway's core components. A comprehensive analysis was performed, resulting in identification of 111 miRNAs that potentially target PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. From this extensive list, 7 miRNAs was selected for further investigation based on their consistent downregulation across leukemia subtypes. Except for hsa-miR-199a-3p, remaining six miRNAs have been extensively studied in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Given high similarity between AML and CML, it is believed that six miRNAs which are not studied in context of CML may also be advantageous for curing chemoresistance in CML. Building upon this knowledge, it is reasonable to speculate that a combination therapy approach involving use of miRNAs alongside TKIs may offer improved therapy for TKIs-resistant CML compared to TKIs monotherapy alone.\", 'authors': ['Singh'], 'journal': 'Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)', 'doi': '10.1007/s12032-023-02161-z', 'copyright': None}, {'date': '2023-09-12', 'title': 'Monophosphoryl lipid A-assembled nanovaccines enhance tumor immunotherapy.', 'abstract': 'Therapeutic cancer nanovaccines can induce strong antitumor immunity and establish long-term immune memory and have shown potential for curing tumors in some clinical trials.

Here, we developed minimal-component cancer nanovaccines, monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA)-assembled nanovaccines (MANs), that could facilitate the clinical application of nanovaccines. The MANs were formed by protein antigens extracted from chemotherapy-induced tumor cell cultures and the amphiphilic immune adjuvant MPLA. Compared with free chemotherapy-induced antigens, MANs can activate the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated signalling pathway and promote adaptive immunity against tumor antigens. Mechanistic analysis indicated that MANs induced antigen capture of DCs and promoted the activation of DCs and T cells, thereby optimizing the ratio of CD8', 'authors': ['Li', 'Hao', 'Pan', 'Wang', 'Min'], 'journal': 'Acta biomaterialia', 'doi': 'S1742-7061(23)00547-0', 'copyright': None}]\n",
