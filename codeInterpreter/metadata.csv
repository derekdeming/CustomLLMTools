MacLab_RNAseq_mouse_invitro_cold_twelve_vs_zero,Bulk RNA-seq,Mouse,Twelve days,Zero days,E1,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were isolated from C57BL/6J mice. Mature adipocytes were exposed to 31°C for 0, 1 or 12 days. For the cells cold exposed for 12 days, the MSCs were cultured at 37°C prior to and for the first four days of adipogenesis, after which cells were moved to 31°C for 12 days. The cells cold exposed for 1 day were moved to 31°C 15 days after adipocyte differentiation. The cells cold exposed for 0 days were cultured at 37°C consistently. All cells were harvested 16 days after adipocyte differentiation.",GSE159451,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000988#sec038,morimori@umich.edu,TBD
